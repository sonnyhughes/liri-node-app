# liri-node-app
While SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

## How to Use:
The LIRI understands 4 types of request: <br>
1. my-tweets <br>
2. spotify-this-song <br>
3. movie-this <br>
4. do-what-it-says <br>

First request will go fetch my latest tweets. <br>
Second request searches a song title as an argument and returns artist and album info. <br>
Third request searches a movie title as an argument and returns movie info. <br>
Fourth request will do any of the above 3, but will read request input out of a text file named random.txt. <br>
